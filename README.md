# BotGuys
Project made for CSCI 4440 - Software Design &amp; Documentation.

Worked on by Jesse Diaz, Sam Cashman, Pierson Garcia, Michael Pan, and Matthews DeJesus.

Our discord bot, Lantern, will be able to play various card games.
Can play:
- Blackjack
- Poker
- Uno

# For Developers:
We have included a requirements.txt file of all necessary libraries in order to make your own bot based off of Lantern. You will also need to create a folder called `logs`, as well as a `bot_token.txt` and `guild_id.txt` in the configs folder to hold your bot token and guild id respecitvely.

# For Users:
The invite link for Lantern is [Here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1146514624288673992&scope=bot&permissions=378024691776). Please enjoy, and reach out if you have any issues.
